Installation:

(1) Put this folder in '~/.icons/', i.e. in the hidden folder ".icons" in your home directory (create it if it doesn't exist);

(2) In GNOME3, you could update the icon cache with the following command in Terminal, replacing <USER_NAME> with your user name:

	gtk-update-icon-cache-3.0 /home/<USER_NAME>/.icons/nouveGnomeGray

In GNOME2, do:

	gtk-update-icon-cache /home/<USER_NAME>/.icons/nouveGnomeGray

(3) In GNOME3, choose the theme from Advanced Settings >  Theme > Icon Theme. In GNOME2, choose it from System > Preferences > Appearence > Theme > Customize Theme > Icons.

This is true for Debian-based systems, at least.
